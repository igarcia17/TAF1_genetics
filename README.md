# TAF1_genetics
Genetics analysis related to TAF1 and their interactors related to MS.
1. GSEA RNAseq data
   From two DeSeq results, a) Ribominus and b) PolyA, both aligned using Salmon.
   Use all databases. I have run it on Mus musculus data base, for human tell me how to handle duplicates on ENSID.
2. Gene-set analysis of MAGMA for in silico validation of GSEA results. Check for MS, esophageal-gastric cancer and ALS.
3. GO categories of interactors in column O, sheet DATA of file 'interactores_and_other_data.xlsx' and gene-set analysis of emerged categories
4. [DONE] Gene-set analysis of MAGMA for those interactors, 4 sets: only WT, only mut, not differential, all together. Found in column O.
5. ORA with oligodendrocytes markers over the genes on the CHIP-seq pause peak.
