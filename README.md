# TAF1_genetics
Genetics analysis related to TAF1 and their interactors related to MS.
1. GSEA RNAseq data
   From two DeSeq results, a) Ribominus and b) PolyA, both aligned using Salmon.
   Use all databases
2. Gene-set analysis of MAGMA for in silico validation of GSEA results. Check for MS, esophageal-gastric cancer and ALS.
3. GO categories of interactors in column O, sheet DATA of file 'interactores_and_other_data.xlsx' -> hago gene set basandome en estas categorias o que tenia que hacer?
4. [DONE] Gene-set analysis of MAGMA for those interactors, 4 sets: only WT, only mut, not differential, all together.
5. ORA with oligodendrocytes markers over the genes on the CHIP-seq pause peak.
